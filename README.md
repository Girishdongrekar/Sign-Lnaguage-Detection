This project implements real-time object detection using the YOLOv10 model in Python. The script captures video input from a webcam, processes each frame, and identifies objects within the frame using the trained YOLOv10 model.
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that is fast and accurate. This project leverages YOLOv10 to detect objects in real-time from a webcam feed. The primary goal is to demonstrate the capabilities of the YOLOv10 model for practical applications, such as surveillance, monitoring, or automation.
Real-time object detection using the YOLOv10 model.
Processes video input directly from a webcam.
Draws bounding boxes and labels detected objects on each frame.
Displays the detection results in a live video feed.
